## Maximize Profit

Landlords can maximize profit by knowing what expected rental rates will be in the future!

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("WebpageScreenshot.png")
```


## Holts-Winter Forecast

The dashboard relies on a Holts-Winter time-series forecasting algorithm.
See code example below

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
hwFit <- hw(timeSeries, h=18)
plot(hwFit)
```

## Model Output

```{r, warning=FALSE}
timeSeries1 <- ts(df[,"One_One"], start=c(1999,1),end=c(2016,2),frequency=4)
timeSeries1 <- window(timeSeries1, start = 2006, end=2016.50)
timeSeries2 <- ts(df[,"Two_Two"], start=c(1999,1),end=c(2016,2),frequency=4)
timeSeries2 <- window(timeSeries2, start = 2006, end=2016.50)
timeSeries3 <- ts(df[,"Average"], start=c(1999,1),end=c(2016,2),frequency=4)
timeSeries3 <- window(timeSeries3, start = 2006, end=2016.50)
```

Using 10 years of data from 2006 - 2016 the model makes the following forecasts about San Jose Rental rates in Q3 2020

* 1 Bedroom/1 Bath: `r paste0("$",format(tail(hw(timeSeries1, h=18)$mean,1)[[1]],digits = 0, big.mark = ","))`

* 2 Bedroom/2 Bath: `r paste0("$",format(tail(hw(timeSeries2, h=18)$mean,1)[[1]],digits = 0, big.mark = ","))`

* Average: `r paste0("$",format(tail(hw(timeSeries3, h=18)$mean,1)[[1]],digits = 0, big.mark = ","))`
